# Lottery Smart Contract

## Overview
The `Lottery` contract is a simple decentralized application (dApp) that allows users to enter a lottery by sending a minimum amount of Ether. The contract owner (manager) can pick a random winner from the pool of participants, and the entire balance of the contract is transferred to the selected winner. This contract demonstrates the basic mechanics of a lottery system on the Ethereum blockchain.
